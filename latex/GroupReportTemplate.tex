%METHODS- I think algorithms should go here rather than code. Any chunks of code that are necessary for the 
%report should go into the appendix
\section{Method \label{sec:met}}

 
\subsection{Finite Difference }


\subsection{Assymetric Finite Volume }


\subsection{3D algorithm}






%RESULTS- Many plots here, I imagine.

% I thought we wouldn't need Bibtex because I doubt we will have many references. With that in mind,
% it is probably a better idea to type references in manually.


%BIBLIOGRAPHY-I have made a basic template for references but here is a good link to a page for making reference if anyone can't remember how to do references:
