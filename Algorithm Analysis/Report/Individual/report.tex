    Our team was tasked with using numerical methods to calculate the electric field in a system with the addition of a conducting object. This task can be made more time-effective by efficient and optimised algorithm designs which shall be discussed.

\section{Introduction}
% A short brief on the aims of the project and the methods used to obtain them

\section{Contributions}
% Briefly discuss all the code contributions I have made

\section{Code Structure}
% Describe code structure

\section{Algorithms}
% Perhaps discuss each algorithm and what optimisations have been made between the original and fast version

\section{Possible Additions}
% What could be added to the project and where could this project be used

\section{Conclusion}
